# Welcome to the MangKeKe Bot!

This is a discord bot that helps you keep track of the manga you are currently reading. I was inspired to create this when I was in bed at 2am reading manga. I accidentally deleted all 500 tabs on my phone and I couldn't figure out what chapter I was on for the mangas I was reading (ï¼´â–½ï¼´) . I want a way to keep track of my mangas but I hate spread sheets and the apps for them on my phone. So instead I decided to use a discord bot that I could text so it would update the google sheet for me and let me know when my mangas have updated. I already text my friends as if they were my notes so instead of bothering them I will use this bot! Ù©(âŠ™â€¿âŠ™)Û¶

## How to run the bot
Create a google sheet with your manga data. Follow instructions to set up google sheet api (create a google cloud project and get an oauth key) . Run the googleSheets.js to create credentials (crendetials.json and token.json) . 
Follow instructions on discord.js to add the discord bot to your server. Then run the index.js 
>  node index.js

### getMangaOfTheDay is not a command but a core functionality
This function schedules a message at 1am everyday to send the mangas that should have releases. So for example, Kagurabachi updates on sunday. Therefore on sunday you should see a message from the bot reminding you to read the new chapter!
